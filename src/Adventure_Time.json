            "[Bugs, worms, and mollusk are having a dance party. They are being spied on from above by BMO who is looking through telescope on the observation boat.]",
            "BMO: [Laughs] Dancing is cool! Check it out, yo! [preforms the \"arm wave\"] Aaa! Ha haa! This one is called \"The Worm\"! [Flops on its belly. Suddenly a giant purple bird swoops in and picks up BMO.] Aaaaah!!",
            "[The Giant purple bird takes BMO to its nest where loudly chirping chicks await. The bird heaves until BMO (who is screaming) is dropped into the open beak of a chick. BMO forces its way out only to be pushed repeatedly down by the bird until it appears to be swallowed. Afterward the bird flops over the nest and sleeps.][When morning arrives, BMO opens the mouth of the baby chick and climbs out. It runs to the edge of the nest to see the Tree Fort from a distance.]",
            "BMO: Oh no, it's crazy far. [It looks back to see the Giant bird still asleep and then escapes by climbing over the side to the edge of the cliff.] Okay, now easy does it. Easy...easy...\"",
            "[Suddenly popping out from beneath the nest...]",
            "A worm: Hey man it\u2019s safe in here!! You can hide in here!! [This causes BMO to tumble off the edge] Oh, shoot man, uh ooh.",
            "BMO: Eeeeeh! [Tumbles down a dirty hill side until it hits a rock and lands on its face. A loud crack is heard as BMO is face downward. It sits up and notices that its face plate has been cracked down the middle] Ooo... oh no! My face! Finn! Jake! Kiss my face! [Looks around] Hmmm... [Falls on its side] so, this is the pits.",
            "[A bubble appears from an empty cup.]",
            "Bubble: I hear that, friend. Do you mind if I wallow with you a bit? I'm a bubble.",
            "BMO: Okay, nothing stopping a bubble. [Shrugs]",
            "Bubble: [Sighs] That's what they say. [rests on a small mound] Looks like you've given up on things. I'm thinking about giving up on things myself. I've been lost in this wilderness a long time. Maybe you and me can wait here, to get eaten by a carnivore!",
            "BMO: No, Bubble. I know two heroes who can help you!",
            "Bubble: You do?",
            "BMO: Yes! Help me get to my home, and, and we will help you find your home!",
            "Bubble: Your friends sound great!",
            "BMO: [Trying to climb over a rock and a branch] They are! They are huge!",

            "Bubble: Cool.",
            "BMO: Yeah! [trips and stumbles again] What about your home?",
            "Bubble: My home? I think that my home is very large and very beautiful. But I can't pin down these memories it... haunts me. [Turns back to see BMO has tripped and fell on its face.]",
            "BMO: Oops, I wasn't listening to your story.",
            "[They enter a clearing full of mushrooms and a loud bang is heard.]",
            "Bubble: What was that?",
            "BMO: It's a carnivore waiting to eat us.",
            "Bubble: Nooo! [hides behind BMO.]",
            "BMO: Don't worry Bubble, [picks up a mushroom] I got everything under control. [Walking in the direction of the sound, BMO tosses the mushroom at the supposed carnivore] [When BMO gets a good look at what it is, it gasps loudly] It's a baby! [Runs over to hug it.]",
            "Baby: [Gurgles and squeals at BMO.]",
            "Bubble: [Comes out of hiding] What's a baby doing in the wilderness?",
            "BMO: He must be lost like us! We should take him with us. Maybe we can help him find his home, too. What a handsome baby. [looks at the baby's left hand, which is flipper-like and covers it with a leaf] Handsome baby.",
            "[It is now nighttime as BMO drags the baby by the arm through the forest with Bubble still following.]",
            "BMO: Bubble, what do you think our baby's name is?",
            "Bubble: How about \"Sparkle\"?",
            "BMO: No, I think he looks like a \"Ricky.\"",
            "Bubble: Hmmm.",
            "BMO: Oo, Bubble! Ricky! Look! [It drops the baby's hand to see a rickety bridge and a long drop to a river] I have a bad news: the bridge doesn't have guard rails.",
            "Bubble: I don't think we should cross it then.",
            "[Loud howling and cawing comes from the forest. BMO and Bubble both turn towards the noises.]",
            "BMO: I don't think we have any choice! I really sure there really is a carnivore this time! [turns towards the baby who gets up] Ricky, you should go first.",
            "Baby: [Gurgles]",
            "BMO: [Pulls the baby close] You are so beautiful... and I love you. Go Ricky! [BMO gives it a pat on the bottom, sending him forward.]",
            "Baby: [Crawls to the middle of the bridge]",
            "BMO: Okay, Ricky, slow and steady, [The baby crawls to the side of the bridge.] Ricky...Ricky?",
            "BMO & Bubble: Ricky! Sparkle! [The baby tumbles over the bridge's side.]",
            "BMO: [Runs to the area the baby fell] Bravery! [and dives after him] Oh nooo-o-o-o!",
            "Baby: [Gurgles and floats on its back down the river]",
            "BMO: [Emerges from the water and climbs on his head] One second, sweetie! Hmm, a deadly water fall!",
            "Bubble: BMO?",
            "BMO: Bubble, you have to save our lives!",
            "Bubble: Eeeeh... maybe I can, hold out this leaf. [Pushes tiny leaf down.]",
            "[The leaf hits a stick which hits a glass bottle which hits a rock that knocks over a tall stump with a bird on it. The stump causes an antlered skull to hit a trunk balanced on another like a see-saw, that launches a bee hive that has enough moment to hit a large boulder that is next to a skeleton dressed in hunting gear, smashing it and firing a gun shot that hits a standing tree trunk and falls into the river next to the waterfall that BMO and the Baby are heading down.]",
            "BMO: Thank you Bubble! I think my batteries are wet. [opens hatch bottom and batteries drop out] Good-bye [Falls over]",
            "[Morning comes and BMO is dry.]",
            "Baby: [Gurgles and picks up the batteries and places them back into BMO's compartment]",
            "BMO: [Turns on] Oooo, good morning everyone, I didn't have any dreams.",
            "[They continue through the forest. This time, BMO is dragging the baby by the foot.]",
            "Baby: [Starts fussing. Its face turns red and appears about to cry.]",
            "Bubble: He looks fussy; maybe he's hungry.",
            "BMO: My hungry baby, what am I going to do with you? [Kisses the baby's foot]",
            "Baby: [Sits up and faces BMO, who has picked up a rock]",
            "BMO: Potato.",
            "Baby: [Becomes more upset]",
            "BMO: Eat your potato, Ricky!",
            "Baby: [Takes the rock and begins to suck on it. This appears to calm it down.]",
            "[A howl is heard and surprises them.]",
            "BMO: It's the carnivore! Everybody! Hide! [BMO and Bubble dive into a tree stump filled with acorns] Psst, Ricky! Please, hide!",
            "Baby: [Sucks on the rock and pats its belly]",
            "BMO: [Crawls out of the stump to grab Ricky by the foot and attempt to get him inside] Oh, Ricky. Help me out here!",
            "Mother: [Emerges from the trees with her flipper hand against her lips] [Gasps] My baby!",
            "Baby: [Seeing its mother, puts its own flipper hand to his lips and blows.]",
            "Mother: I was so worried about you, Sparkle!",
            "Bubble: Sparkle...",
            "Mother: [Begins to pull Sparkle out of the trunk with BMO trying to pull him back in.]",
            "BMO: No, Ricky! No, no no! No, no!",
            "Bubble: BMO, that's his mom! Let go!",
            "BMO: [Whines.]",
            "Mother: [Holding up Sparkle] My beautiful baby. [Sparkle shrieks happily.] [She frowns at BMO] You should be ashamed of yourself! [Walks back into the forest]",
            "BMO: [Looks down at the ground]",
            "[In a heavily wooded area, Bubble zooms around making motor noises and comes up to BMO.]",
            "Bubble: Hey, the path ahead looks pretty clear and there were these... uh, there... BMO, are you okay?",
            "BMO: I am sad, Bubble. I miss baby Ricky. I miss him so much already. And I miss Finn and I miss Jake. And I got dirt all in my butt circuits! And Bubble...",
            "Bubble: Yes, BMO?",
            "BMO: I-I don't think I'm ever going to get home again.",
            "Bubble: Don't cry. Sparkle is safe now and we did that. Thanks to us he's going to grow up and be anything he wants to be: a strapping horse whisperer or a sexy hitman or whatever. And things are looking up for us, too; I saw some bugs up ahead who look pretty with it.",
            "BMO: [Puts its hands to its face plate and gasps]",
            "Bubble: Maybe they can gives us directions or something.",
            "BMO: Oh, my gosh! Oh oh oh! Bubble!",
            "Bubble: What?!",
            "BMO: I know those guys, Bubble! Those are my homeboys, my homeboys, those are my homeboys! We are close to my home!",
            "Bubble: [Excited gasp] Yeeah! Come on, BMO!",
            "BMO: Yeah!! [Falls on its face] Yeeaah!",
            "[The two run across the field towards the Tree Fort.]",
            "BMO: It's been so long, I can't wait to have some bread-and-butter!",

            "Bubble/Air: Nooo, see that's what's so great. Now we can be together forever, BMO, every minute of every day. No more privacy, no more quiet, no more alone. Every room you ever go in, I'll already be there... waiting... forever and ever, until the end of time.",

            "Squirrel:  [Finn creeps towards the doorway] Well, I made sure he ate that apple like you guys told me to do, but get this! [The scene now shows a small wood platform with a glowing green skull at the center. Two squirrels, two woodpeckers, an owl, a chipmunk, a beaver, and a porcupine all sit around it] It made him smaller! I think it mighta been cursed you guys!",
            "Owl:  Well a-course it was cursed! We're tryin' to stop the human! [The squirrel looks confused] [sighs] [He puts a hand on his forehand] Look, just do me a kindness and go get me some more nut milk. [The squirrel backs out from the circle to get it] Come on fellas! I feel like I'm the only one comin' up with ideas here, Lenny! How do you think we should stop the human?",

            "Squirrel:  What?",
            "Finn:  Uuuh, I didn't say anything. [The squirrel looks away] [Pause] What are they gonna do to me?",
            "Squirrel:  What?",
            "Finn:  [Louder than before] What are they gonna do-",

            "Finn:  So does that mean I'm a prisoner forever?",
            "Squirrel:  Well yes. And no. Are you a prisoner? Yes. Will you ever be free? No. In the tree, part of the tree. It's very simple.",
            "Finn:  Doesn't that mean that you can't leave the tree either?",
            "Squirrel:  No I- Well yes and no. Am I allowed to leave the tree? No. Have I already left the tree? Am I miles away from the tree right now flying around like the flying squirrel that I am? Yes! In my mind! In- my- mind! [Turns and looks wistfully out the window at the clouds]",
            "Finn:  [Looking concerned] Do you like it here?",
            "Squirrel:  Yeah! [Shrugging] Well, yes and no. Do I like the nuts and acorns? Yes. Do I like it when they put me down and say mean things like \"You're not a flying squirrel, you're just a regular squirrel! Nyaah!\"? No. Do I wanna fly away from this place now? Yes. Would I make a break for it if I had a buddy to break out with? Yes.",
            "Finn:  Hey buddy.",
            "Squirrel:  What?",
            "Finn: [Steps through the somewhat wide bars] Let's get outta here. [The squirrel looks elated, now Finn is riding the squirrel as he runs through the hallways. Now back in the meeting room, the woodpecker is telling the owl something and the owl is chuckling along with the others. Finn is slowly lowered towards his disc by the squirrel] I got it!",
            "Owl:  What are you doing regular, nonflying squirrel? Put that back! [The squirrel blows a raspberry at him] [gasps] How dare you! [Finn and the squirrel run away laughing] Well alright! Everybody after those\u2026two!",
            "Finn:  [Him and the squirrel run out of the tree onto the branch. Finn is walking on his own now] Okay! I'm gonna throw the disc alongside the branch the we'll jump on it and fly away!",

            "Finn:  Perfect! Throw! [The disc flies straight, but then veers off like the first time] Sooo, It's a- It's a good thing you're a flying squirrel. Huh.",
            "Squirrel:  Well yes and no. [Chanting is heard behind then and the squirrel rotates his head making a cracking sound]",
            "Finn:  [He grabs the squirrel and drags him to the side of the branch in front of him, kicks him off, and jumps after him] [As he's falling] Peace ooooout! [They are falling extremely fast now] Okay! Activate your squirrel flaps!",
            "Squirrel:  Flaps? No, I just have regular squirrel arms!",

I just gotta stretch up past these trees and see where we're at. [Stretches head above canopy] Dang. It's all misty! It's kinda nice up here, though.

Right now, [Points left finger to first step], you're at Tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon, [Points left finger to second step] you'll be at Tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road [points left finger to fifth step], you'll make it to Tier 5, where she'll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong, beautiful stomach.

            "Finn:  I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality. [Moves his foot nearer and nearer to the floor]",
            "Jake:  NOOOOO!!",
            "Finn:  [Places foot on floor; it suddenly catches fire] AAAAH!!! [Putting fire out] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!",
            "Jake:  I was just playin' around with my imagination... [In Jake's view, everything is on fire and lava is on the floor] ...and then everything got intense.",
            "Finn:  It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!",
            "Jake:  [To himself] Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...",
            "Finn:  Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries.",
            "[Everything in the room begins to melt.]",
            "Finn and Jake:  WHOA!",
            "Finn:  But first stop imagining lava!",
            "Jake:  I can't! My imagination's too amazing!",
            "Finn:  Imagine turning your imagination off!",
            "Jake:  I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters.",
            "Finn:  Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?",
            "Jake:  You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!",
            "Finn:  Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!",
            "Jake:  Neat! [Finn and he enter the den] Grab that missile.",
            "Finn:  Okay.",
            "Jake:  And... get that cosmic gauntlet.",
            "Finn:  Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH! [Finn leaps into an invisible wall.] What did I just hit?!",
            "Jake:  I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.",
            "Finn:  Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?",
            "Jake:  Oh, there's one now. [Troll roars] Look out!",
            "Finn:  Aah! I can feel it on my foot! [They stumble over, and Finn's shoe seemingly floats in midair.] I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!",
            "Jake:  You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!",
            "Finn:  Yah, yah! [Finn's blows finally start to land.]",
            "Jake:  Alright! You're gettin' him, man! [Finn continues attacking] Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family. [Finn kicks in the air and a scream is heard.] Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face! [Troll wife yells incomprehensibly.] She's comin' back for revenge.",
            "Finn:  Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!",
            "[Finn leaps out the window into the knife storm.]",
            "Jake:  The knife storm, remember?!?! [Finn frantically pulls himself and Jake up to the attic. They rest and pant heavily.] Oh, boy... Ooh... Finn, I found some candy. [Eats some] It tastes like banana candy, man. [Sips drink] Here, man. Try some.",
            "[Finn eats some candy.]",
            "Finn:  [Standing up] Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.",
            "Jake:  Okay! [Does it] It is done.",
            "Finn:  [Walks out cautiously] Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!",
            "Riddle Master:  No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle.",
            "Finn:  [To Jake] An imaginary riddle master?",
            "[Jake laughs sillily.]",
            "Finn:  [Sighs] Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test.",
            "Riddle Master:  Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land.",
            "Finn:  [Ready] LAY IT ON ME!!",
            "Riddle Master:  Yes, um... The riddle, uh... It... cometh... uh...",
            "Jake:  I can't imagine a riddle.",
            "Finn:  Dude, just make it super easy.",
            "Riddle Master:  THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle?",
            "Finn:  Man, that riddle sucks.",
            "Riddle Master:  THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!!",
            "Finn:  YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!",
            "[Finn launches it and it explodes on the other side of the bridge. Finn and Jake scream in pain.]",
            "Jake:  You exploded the snakes right at us!!",
            "Finn:  I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!",
            "Jake:  I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!",
            "Finn:  Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!",
            "Jake: AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!! [Finn evades the obstacle.] Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck! [Finn jumps up and does so. A weapon is heard charging up. Jake gasps.] The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!",
            "Finn:  Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!",
            "[Bazooka Goblin laughs.]",
            "Finn:  Don't you do it...",
            "[Bazooka Goblin continues laughing.]",

            "[Finn and Jake laugh and do a celebratory fist bump.]",
            "Finn:  Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me.",
            "Jake:  Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed.",
            "Finn:  Is it clear?",
            "Jake:  Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you.",
            "[Finn fidgets around and mumbles to himself (\"Ah... where, ah... Where is this, I ca\u2014Ah... man.\") before finding the machine.]",
            "Finn:  Oh! I found the shut-off lever!",
            "Jake:  Cool, man! [Invisible girl giggles.] Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby. [Another girl giggles.] What're you laughin' at?",
            "Finn:  Alright. I'm gonna turn it off. [Finn is suddenly hit by an invisible force.] UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!",
            "Jake:  Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!",
            "Finn:  What?! Well, how do I kill it?! [Finn gets beaten down.]",
            "Jake:  I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this! [Punches it] Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!",
            "Finn:  Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!! [Finn pulls the lever; Jake falls down; Finn's wounds are healed.] Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake? [Jake groans.] Hey, come on. Wake up, man.",

            "Jake:  [Completely regular tone] Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy.",
            "Finn:  Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?",
            "Jake:  I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.",
            "Finn:  Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!",
            "Jake:  But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you.",
            "Finn:  Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing. [Sighs]",
            "[Jake reaches for his viola and plays a continuous G\u266e]",
            "Finn:  Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note.",
            "Jake:  One note is all that is needed.",
            "Finn:  [Scoffs] I'm gonna turn your imagination back on. [Fidgets around and mumbles to self] Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!",
            "Jake:  True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?",
            "Finn:  I remembereth.",
            "Jake:  I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.",
            "Finn:  No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now... [Saddened] ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go... [Finn appears in his imagination land.] What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad. [Imagination back-on machine appears] Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!",
            "[Suddenly, the Lyre Player enters dancing and singing the Imagination Song.]",
            "Finn:  [Disappointed] Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something. [He imagines a penguin, and a bowl of spaghetti. The Lyre Player trips over the former and lands in the latter; Finn laughs.] Now for that switch.",
            "Bellamy Bug:  [Entering] Good morrow, sir! My name is Bellamy Bug! Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy.",
            "Finn:  No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!",
            "Bellamy Bug:  [Giggles] I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!",
            "Finn:  REPRESENT THIS! [Smacks Bellamy] And this. [Imagines two arms protruding out of Bellamy (one cephalopodic and one robotic) which both punch him.]",

            "[Penguins take Bellamy away.]",
            "Finn:  Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright. [Runs over to the machine] I hope this works, Jake! [Pulls lever; Jake's imagination returns.] Haha, yeah! [A fairy comes near the machine giggling.] Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button! [The fairy pushes the button anyway with her butt]",

But Grod's pretty good at drawing, so...[Grob draws and Gob narrates] Plague of shadows. Magic Man brought our shadows to life. They attacked us, and ravaged Mars. Very impressive, Grod.",
            "Grod:  Thanks bro.",
            "Gob:  To the plague of the oneness. As we gathered to hold hands and sing our community song, Magic Man cast an evil spell that made our arms grow together. Much suffering ensued. And what about that one time when he turned all the water into hair, and we all got so thirsty we drank it? And when we drank it, we went bald! Many of us did not recover and to this day, hide our losses behind groovy headgear. [touches his headgear] Dark off please. [it grows light again]",

            "Abe Lincoln:  Magic Man, I give you two choices. One is total annihilation. The wand will touch you, and your soul will meet with Death. The second is to use the power of the wand to convert your body to living stardust, where your consciousness will be jettisoned into the infinite cosmos, on an endless journey of wonder and DISCOVERYYYYYY!!!!!",
            "Jake:  Whoa. That second one sounds pretty cool. I mean, yeah. I'm way into that. Except...oh...I would really miss my best friend. His name is Finn, and I think it would mess him up if I wasn't around.",

            "Princess Bubblegum: [Muffled scream as she hits him with a pillow and rips the tape from her mouth.] Ice King, what are you doing in my bedroom?!",
            "Ice King:  Baby, I was trying to surprise you by moving you to my place while you sleep, then have you wake up to breakfast in bed, but now you've ruined the surprise, way to go.",
            "Princess Bubblegum:  Do you think I like being kidnapped is that what you think I want!",
            "Ice King:  Okay, here we go, you're the victim right? You know what, since day one I've been doing everything to make this relationship work and for what?!",

            "Ice King:  No, baby! What are you doing?! [Still being dragged, he whines] Baby bear! [Pulling loose from the guards, he runs back to the princess' side on bended knee.] This is just so crazy, if you can honestly look into your heart and tell me you want me to leave, I'll go!",
            "Princess Bubblegum:  [Serious] Okay, leave.",
            "Ice King:  [Taken aback] Uh-what? D-did you look in your heart, like all around it?",
            "Princess Bubblegum:  [Sternly] Yes.",
            "Ice King:  I see. Then obviously you have got some heavy emotions stirring in you and you have said some very rash things.

[He gets out, warps a towel around himself and walks to his bedroom.] [There he sits on his bed and picks up a paparazzi shot of Princess Bubblegum and sighs.] All I can think about... is you, baby girl. I gotta leave Ooo, start somewhere fresh. [Walking out to the throne room dressed with a duffel bag he goes to a sleeping Gunter.] Goodbye, Gunter, you're the... man of the house now.

            "[The next scene is the Ice King awash on a sandy shore and regaining consciousness, he coughs a bit and immediately two orange fish flop from his mouth.] Ick, where am I- [coughs up a crab. And all three creatures wander back into the waters.]",
            "Ice King:  Where am I? [Stands up] Hmm, no signs of life. Just me and these palm fronds, [reaches down to pluck a few strands, and heads back to the shore and sits.] And that bird over there. [The bird pecks the sand. Ice King removes his crown] Well, won't be needing this anymore, [kisses the crown and secures it to this beard's end. Then, taking the palm strands he fashions himself a hat. He picks up the bird to have it snip off an extra piece and tosses it away.] [Placing the hat on his head he sighs] I miss her, man. [His wallowing is cut short as he hears someone singing a song in the distance.] Hello? [He goes to investigate.] Is someone here? [Muttering] Must be from somewhere. [He spots a sanding hill and runs towards it, when he reaches the top.] There, now I can look around and- sweet mother of Glob! This island doesn't have a lady - this island is a lady!",

            "Ice King:  Crazy jealous?! [Panicking and looking for a place to hide, but there is none. He runs around but then just decides to curl into a ball near the mouth of the island.]",

I totally puked in Jimmy's stereo and killed the party I was at, he was like, \"Hey, Party God, you can't spin faster than me!\" And I was like, \"I totally can, Jimmy.\" So we started spinnin', then I got super dizzy and was like: Blaugh blaugh, right into the speaker! [Peaks his head into a bush and pulls out the boombox] Hurr hurr, found it. Okay, I'm bouncing out, babe.",

            "Mountain Man:  Well you should be! It\u2019s not fair to those animals and it\u2019s not fair to me! I might just start to cry again, you know? [Starts to cry again]",

            "Head Marauder :  Well we don\u2019t like not roughhousing! Ya see the problem here?",
            "Finn:  Well. Well what if we rotate the entire mountain 180 degrees around, so the mountain\u2019s facing the other direction. That way, you guys can keep roughhousing and the mountain doesn't have to watch it!",
            "Head Marauder :  Sounds fine with me!",
            "Finn:  What do ya say mountain!",
            "Mountain Man:  That\u2019s okay. Only if you guys promise to stay healthy and not roughhouse after you rotate me.",

            "Bufo:  Yes. It's been heading for this temple for 847 years. Only the magic of the ultimate wizards keeps it from getting any closer. Quickly, add your power to that of the orb.",

[giggles] When two people, eh- will- Will you marry me! [He looks at his foot] Oh yah! [He begins crying and the penguins start licking up his tears] Yes! Yes drink up the tears! Drink up those good luck tears! [Gunter approaches, but Ice King smacks him away] No, not you Gunter! You\u2019re on a low-salt diet! Huh? [He looks down at his foot] Uh-a-what\u2019s that dear? Oh! I almost forgot! [He makes a fanfare tune] Do do-do do-Do! [He pulls out a ring and puts it on his toe] It\u2019s a wife ring! [He pulls out another ring and place it on his own finger] This one\u2019s for me. I\u2019m the husband. That means I get the remote control THREE days a week and you get it four! [laughs excitedly] [He has his foot pulled up to eye level and turned around as if it were sitting next to him on the balcony] Ahhh, Sweetie, this is bliss. It feels so math to finally be normal. Not like those two freaks. [He points to Finn and Jake sticking their thumbs in a snowman] What are they doin\u2019 over there? Anyway! I-oh, who\u2019s that? [He looks at his other foot and there is a winking face on it] Oh. Oh my. [He looks nervous]",
            "BMO:  [Now we are at the Tree Fort] Poor Football, you\u2019ve come so far, but still have so much to learn.",
            "Football:  [BMO is talking to his reflection in the window] But I don\u2019t understand BMO. I\u2019m a real baby girl now. I can smell the reddest lilacs. I can hear the screaming squirrels! Screaming for nuts! Oh my gosh! I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s true!",
            "BMO:  No, Football. That\u2019s not enough. You have to learn manners too. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be all alone!",
            "Football:  Alone? But-but what about you BMO?",
            "BMO:  I will not always be here to protect you Football. No, you must learn. Here look! [Pulls out grapefruit spoon] This is a grapefruit spoon. It is only for eating grapefruit. [Pulls out a salt shaker and shakes salt into the air] This is a salt shaker. Here, you try. [BMO and his reflection are both shaking the salt up into the air and laughing] [BMO pulls out a strange contraption] Now this is a turnip grincher. [Football looks at it quizzically] For grinching. Aaand, this is how you drink tea. [BMO sticks out his pinky and sips the tea] Ahhh. [The tea pours over his face]",
            "Football:  Like this? [Does not have pinky out] Yuck! [giggles] It\u2019s bitter!",
            "BMO:  No, no. Football like this. [BMO shows Football again]",
            "Football:  Like this?",
            "BMO:  No, like this. [BMO is getting frustrated]",
            "Football:  Like this? [Both BMO and Football begin sparking from the liquids]",
            "BMO:  Like this! [BMO is angry]",
            "Football:  Like this, right?",
            "BMO:  No Football. Do it like- huh? [BMO sees Finn and Jake outside through the window] Sorry Football. Lessons are over for tonight!",
            "BMO:  [Finn sighs. Finn and Jake walk up the ladder to find BMO, all charred, sitting on the couch] Why so glum fellas?",
            "Finn:  [Sounding depressed] We stuck or thumbs in almost every hole today.",
            "Jake:  But we never felt like good boys.",
            "BMO:  I know a thing or two about good boys. Why don\u2019t you try sticking your thumbs in these holes? [BMO is holding his fingers to form a hole over the controllers\u2019 start buttons]",
            "Finn:  [He looks at BMO\u2019s fingers] Controllers? [He looks up to find a video game start screen called \u201cSuper Good Boys\u201d] Haha! Oh yeah! Super Good Boys!",
            "Finn and Jake:  [They use their thumbs to push the buttons through BMO\u2019s fingers] Bawmp! [The characters in the game start picking up trash and cleaning the digital house while BMO giggles]",
            "Cuber:  So, did you guess the theme? Go ahead and pause your viewer now if you need a few more glayble to think about it a little. [A \u201cpause viewer now\u201d card appears for a second] Oho! Now you\u2019ve got it! I can tell! That\u2019s right, the theme is the five tastes. [For each example, a still from the corresponding grayble appears] You see, Jake ate a SWEET plum. Marceline played some SAVORY licks. Tree Trunks had a SOUR taste inside her mouth. Oh my. Gunter wanted to drink the SALTY tears. And Football's tea was BITTER. [He laughs until he supposedly hears something] Huh? What\u2019s that you say? You thought the theme was the five fingers? [he laughs] Don\u2019t be silly! No one\u2019s had five fingers for twenty blablillion glaybles. Five telepathy glands maybe. [he calms down] Ah\u2026 slimmin\u2019. Well anyway, looks like it\u2019s that time again. [waves goodbye] I\u2019ll see you crimpy glimmers on triode flimpin\u2019 the diode! [he laughs as the screen cuts]"

            "Guy #1:  Ohhh, I'm poor. Uh, but what about I trade you for a personal concert at your house? I'll come over later and sing ya like, four songs. I mostly do covers, but I have originals too. Do you own any spoons?",

Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles.",

A lone bunny, facing off against the elements, ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose, a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up. It's becoming clear that Mother Nature has not just knocked on the door, she has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now. Small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home are beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this?!

You'd expect to see a few mudscamps out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat, but I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that storms will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's a triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty Sea Lard is pitchin' right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole, while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. Times like these, supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world, all too often its most salient feature, pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin.",

The Sea Lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back.",

Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple more mighty smashes, and the dam\u2014the dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weigh from the tree above.

            "Tree Trunks: The monster tracks are very real. [shows Wyatt climbing into the window with snow shoes on his feet and holding a pie pan] My husband told me so. [Wyatt grunts, and falls in the window onto the floor] Wyatt!",

[stomps, the cat yowls and hisses, another bush rustles, the creature peeks out then disappears] The peeper! [follows it, goes through a hole in the middle of two trees]",
            "Margaret: I'll show that peepsie the pepper! [tries going through the hole, but can't, tries getting out of it] Joshua, dear, I'm stuck! [the creature growls and comes out from behind a bush behind Margaret] Joshua! The beast outflanked us! [the monster screeches]",
            "Joshua: Gads! [the monster screeches, Joshua goes and punches it] Boom! [the monster picks him up] Do your worst, you masher.",

[grunts, gets herself out of the hole, the monster sniffs Joshua, opens its mouth and puts Joshua's head in its mouth, Margaret gasps and takes a needle out of her hat, goes and stabs it in the monster's butt] Drop that daddy! [the monster screeches, gets on all four legs and runs behind a bush, leaving green slime behind it] Baby cakes! Oh, this is all my fault!",

            "Joshua: Ah, good last meal. Okay, well, I got bit by a monster, a creature of the night. We both know what comes next for me. [picks up a sword and sets it on the table] Just make it snappy, darling.",
            "Margaret: [tearing up] Don't. [sniffles] Don't be melodramatic, Joshua. [holding the Book of Poisons] I've been doing some research. Listen here. I think if we can get a sample of that creature's venom, we can use it to synthesize an antidote. [a thud noise is heard] Joshua?! [drops the book, goes to Joshua] Oh! Puddin' Pie!",
            "Joshua: [groans] I'm fine. Just got to pop out and fetch that venom.",
            "Margaret: You're about as fine as a canary in a cat mine! [goes and takes Joshua to a pull-out bed, lays him on it, goes to a candle on the wall and pulls it down, opening a hidden door to the weapon room, she goes in and grabs a crossbow and arrows, puts her belt on that reads \"Top Dawg,\" goes and puts her hat on a mannequin head and grabs her other hat, the puppies in her womb move] Oof! Hey, where's the fire, kiddo? You stay put. [goes back to Joshua, who is asleep and mumbling, Margaret holds up a walkie-talkie] So's I can keep tabs on you. [sets the walkie-talkie next to Joshua's ear] Feel better. Over. [kisses Joshua's cheek and leaves]",

            "Margaret: [turns around, goes by a trail of green slime] I got the peep peep's trail. In pursuit. [shines her flashlight at trees]",
            "Joshua: You have to say \"over\" or I think you're still talking. Over.",
            "Margaret: [shining her flashlight at an old building that reads \"Pantheon of Savings\" ] Joshua, I've stumbled upon the beast's lair. [shows Joshua's walkie-talkie on the floor] Just hang on, Honey Bunny. Over. [Joshua steps on the walkie-talkie, breaking it, growling from the pain he feels in his head, lays on the table and breaks it, a blue bump starts to grow on his head, the bump throbs, Joshua howls like a wolf, scene goes back to Margaret looking around in the building, a shadowy figure passes her, she turns and shines the flashlight at the creature, Margaret gaps, the monster makes a noise] Stay right there. [shoots an arrow at the creature, the creature shapeshifts so he steps back before the arrow can hit him] What?! [shoots two arrows at the creature, the creature jumps next to Margaret, the two arrows hit a rock, the creature shapeshifts into a cat and meows, then into an owl and hoots, then into a monster with more eyes and it punches Margaret backwards, making her fall on her back, the puppies in her stomach move] Ooh! Not yet! [tries reaching for her crossbow, but can't, the creature shapeshifts into a bigger creature and stretches its head towards Margaret, Margaret keeps trying to reach for her crossbow] Come on, come on! [grabs the crossbow's handle and shoots an arrow above the monster's head, hitting a box of baby items, sending them rumbling and crashing onto the monster. Defeated, the monster groans and shapeshifts into a baby with three eyes and coos] What? What's your angle, slick? You poison my hubby, then play the innocent? [shines her flashlight at the baby items around the room] And what's with all this baby paraphernalia? Wait a tick. Are you a baby?",
            "Monster: [shifts its eyes left and right] Uh-huh.",
            "Margaret: Oh, no! I must've scared the dickens out of you! [the monster sits on the floor and coos] There, there, baby. I'm so sorry...[they both tear up] For this! [punches the monster's face and puts a test tube under its mouth, making its venom go into the tube. Margaret gets up and starts stepping out of the building] I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [the monster's eye stretches and looks out the door, the monster shapeshifts into its normal shape and chuckles in an evil \"You haven't seen the last of me\" tone, then shapeshifts into another shape and shoots lasers from its face diodes at the air, opening a portal. The monster shapeshifts into a circle and stretches into the portal, and the portal closes, the scene changes back to their home, Margaret goes inside (which is more of a mess than before)] Joshua, I got the venom! [the puppies move] Ohhh! Uh oh, this baby business is getting SERIOUS! [breathes carefully and walks into the kitchen, looks out the window, showing Joshua standing by the wall] Joshua! [the puppies move more] Ohhh! Ohhh! [breathes carefully, goes out the window and steps off the dumpster, goes by Joshua]",

            "Joshua: Margaret! [his throbbing bump stretches and makes a splat noise. Margaret drops the test tube (not that she'll be needing the venom now).] Shine the light, dear. [Margaret turns the flashlight on and aims it at his head with a recently burst mutant bump.] Yowzers! [Margaret shines the light at the ground, showing a puppy Jake, spawned out of Joshua's venom bump and freshly drenched in a pond of biofluid.]",

            "Jake:  Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds. [The fat Clown Nurse waves a cookie around, mimicking airplane sounds and plops it into Jake's mouth.] I paid them up front. They don't leave until the job's done. Besides... [He honks the big Clown Nurse's nose.] They're funny. [He honks the big Clown Nurse's nose again, and she farts this time.] [laughs] Look, she just farted.",
            "Head Clown Nurse:  Time for our love therapy.",

            "Finn:  Hmmm...",
            "Tree Stump:  Ring, ring! Look, there's only two choices, bro. Take your pick. There's the path on the left, Hair Fall-Out Path. No more hair again, ever! Or the path on the right, Smelly Path. Makes you smelly forever. Hoohoo, you won't believe it.",
            "Finn:  Isn't there another way?",

            "Finn:  NO! I choose MY WAY!! [He kicks the sign off of her head.] My way.",
            "[Finn runs right through the prickly bushes, screaming all the way. He comes out on the other side, all scratched and covered in thorns. He then comes across a river an walks up to the bank. A bush is on the bank nearby.]",
            "Bush:  Ring ring. Hello, dummy police? Yes, there's a strange dummy lurking around my house. Okay, yes. Thank you. Goodbye.",
            "Finn:  Wha...? [Beats] I need to cross the river. The Cyclops is over there.",
            "Bush:  You can't cross this river. It's impossible! Look! The current is so fast, it'll turn your butt inside-out for real, doofus. And the water's so acidic it'll crump your boat in half. It's like orange juice. It's gross. There's a bridge, but it's a trap! Plus, the water's jamming with electric eels. Wow, so weird. Anyway, that's it, there's no other way around, you dummy.",
            "[While the bush speaks, the camera shows the river's current flowing, and the steaming hull of a boat that was corroded away. The bridge nearby is shown, then two pairs of eyes and shadowy arms pop out. Two electric eels are swimming under the water, their bodies surging with electricity.]",
            "Finn:  But I need to get across.",
            "Bush:  Listen what I'm telling you. There's no way. ...Ugly tramp.",
            "[Another thought of a Clown Nurse crosses Finn's mind. He advances on the bush.]",
            "Finn:  Glob, Glob it, Glob it, Glob it...",
            "Bush:  Huh? What are you saying? \"Globbit, Globbit\"? Who's Globbit?",
            "[Finn snatches the bush and uproots him.]",
            "Finn:  MY WAY!!",
            "[A screaming Finn then charges head-on into the river, using the bush to sweep the water off of the ground beneath. The bush is screaming in pain all the while. Then some electric eels jump out of the water and wrap themselves around Finn, shocking him and singing off the bush's leaves. Finn finally stops on a rock and the eels come off of him. Finn spits out a glob of vomit into the water.]",
            "Bush:  Glibby glob, man! You're crazy! We're not even half way across! You gotta go back, man! It's the only way, you ugly fat-smelling fat-head!",
            "Finn:  NO, MY WAY!! [Frustrated, Finn tosses the now-barren bush all the way across the river. Then he dives in. He emerges from the river, screaming and steaming from the pineapple juice-like water. He then happens upon a strange little man standing next to a wagon with watermelons in it.]",
            "Finn:  [panting] MY WAY! [He quenches the acid by smashing one of the melons over his head.] Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob.",
            "Pan:  Uhh, excuse me, friend. [Finn blabbers his lips together.] You're pretty tall, can you reach up there and get my wheel for me? Gotta get these melons home to my wife. You know how it is.",
            "[Still frustrated as ever, Finn pushes Pan aside and picks up the wagon.]",
            "Finn:  [panting] MY WAY! [He hurls the wagon down the hill. The wagon shatters as it hits the ground, and the melons tumble down the hill.]",
            "Pan:  Watch out, Rainy!",
            "[Rainy realizes too late. She avoids the first one, which rolls over the wigwam house, but the others roll over her, injuring her. Rainy groans in pain.]",
            "Pan:  [gasps] Rainy!",
            "Finn:  Whoops. Uh... man, I'm real sorry.",
            "Pan:  Yeah? [sobs] No doy... friend.",
            "Finn:  But... I can still help. I'll fix your house for you.",
            "Pan:  Just get out of here! Leave us alone!",
            "Finn:  Uh... wh... I... [sighs]",
            "Pan:  Psycho fink.",
            "[Finn walks uphill to a cliff overlooking the valley below. He realizes his plan didn't go as well as he had hoped. He takes off his hat and breaks out in song.]",
            "Finn:  \u266b I was wrong. Was I wrong? No. Yes... Yes... I was wrong. How could it be? I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts. I was wrong. How could it be? Listened to my brain, but ended up insane. The melons rolled...over that lady. I went too far. How could it be? [Finn puts his hat back on.] How did I go... too far? \u266b",
            "[As Finn finishes his song, the camera zooms out to reveal a little beneath the cliff. A giant eye opens up, looks up, and blinks. Suddenly something hunches up from the cliff. It's the Cyclops Finn has been seeking.]",
            "Forest Cyclops:  Hey! I know you're here for my magical tears, but you won't have any, because I never cry.",
            "Finn:  I don't want 'em anymore.",
            "Forest Cyclops:  What? Stop lying. You're here for my tears, aren't you?",
            "Finn:  No. I hurt a small, hairy man's wife. I just wanna go home.",
            "Forest Cyclops:  You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry... but I've got a heart of stone, buddy. I'm EVIL!",
            "Finn:  Dude! What's wrong with you? I said I don't want your tears!",

[He scatters the photos at Finn's feet. He points at his arm.] You see this? This is her forcing my hand. [He grabs his wrist and moves it back and forth.]",
            "Finn: But that's exactly what she's saying. You're both so unreasonable.",
            "Gumbald: You want unreasonable? Get a load of my unreasonably bad boy battle automaton! Her name is The Cake. [He gestures up at The Cake, which fills the chamber they are now standing in.] My niece would never have the ambition for a project like this. But ambition is my whole deal!

            "Finn: I was wrong about you. You're nothing like Bonnie.",
            "Gumbald: Wait. She'll have her cake and eat it too - because she'll be dead! The Cake makes her dead!",
            "[There is a thud and the platform lurches. Finn and Gumbald both cry out.]",
            "Gumbald: What the -",
            "[One of the ropes snaps and Finn and Gumbald are both thrown off the platform, screaming. Jake, who is still on Finn's head, latches onto the platform while Finn falls.]",

            "[Finn catches Gumbald, and Jake slowly lowers them both to the ground by Finn's neck.]",
            "Finn: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. The pain is astonishing.",
            "Gumbald: You could have let me die and saved your princess a lot of trouble. Maybe there is a way to co-exist after all.",

            "Finn: So Jake is literally inside me, controlling my body and I'm standing in front of my girlfriend's entire family.",
            "Gumbald: [Apparently engrossed in the story] No!",
            "Finn: This is my first ever girlfriend. I really want her to like me.",

            "Finn: Thanks, Chicle. But, if I could get serious for a second -",
            "Gumbald: No need, Finn. Your example has said more than words ever could. Chicle, fetch the celebration bucket. I declare all hostilities between Gumbaldia and the Candy Kingdom ended. [He presses a button on his wrist and confetti falls from the ceiling.]",
            "Finn: Yeah!",
            "Jake: Whoo-hoo!",

            "Chicle: [Gasps] Don't look at me! [He runs to an adjacent room and slams the door. Pink smoke poofs out from underneath. Everyone else is silent for a second.]",
            "Lolly: Now there's a guy who - who really cares about his hair!",
            "Finn and Jake: [Together] Oh, cousin Chicle!",
            "Jake: Man, I almost thought that was something really serious.",
            "[The scene changes back to the Candy Kingdom. It is evening, and Princess Bubblegum is holding a peace treaty while she talks to Finn and Jake.]",
            "Princess Bubblegum: I don't believe it. A signed peace treaty? Finn, you're amazing. I could hug you right no- ...Did you stop at a craft store on the way here?",
            "Finn: Oh, the glitter juice. It's part of a weird Gumbaldia treaty-signing ritual. Once I got to know him, your uncle was actually pretty cool. As I get older, I see the most important thing is to empathize with my friends and enemies. Like, co-exist instead of cutting off people's heads and stuff.",
            "[While Finn is talking, Peppermint Butler produces a towel and dries the liquid off Finn and Jake. Some of it gets on him, and in a puff of pink smoke he is transformed into a baby.]",

I was sucking the sauce off them and hucking the shrimp at the ceiling. I kept going back for more and more samples, I could not stop myself. I don't know, man. The shrimp must have gone bad or something, 'cause all that red came right back up. Still invisible and yakking red all down the produce isle. It was awesome.",

            "Jermaine: Yeah.",
            "Jake: I was just hanging out with a couple of ladies outside... or a couple of the same lady. Then bam! Sky-boxed!",
            "Jermaine: Ugh. Jake, I'm here to work. I got to keep everything where it should be. So, uh... so how are you and Finn doing?",
            "[Without looking, Jermaine starts to push the poster through the wall of the box. It falls through the wall, and he falls half outside with it.]",

            "Jermaine: Uh, yeah. Sounds great. See you later.",
            "[Jermaine pulls a hole in the floor until it's under Jake, who falls. He lands on a larger version of his head like a drop of water. The bigger Jake wakes up and breathes deeply.]",

            "Jake: In the dream, Jermaine was wearing a bear suit. I wonder what that symbolizes. Maybe it means Jermaine needs us to visit.",
            "[Jake pulls a strip off of the mouth of the face on the mug, which opens its huge eyes. The eyes and an indicator on the side turns bright red, then the eyes close and Jake pops the aluminum can style top. BMO takes the strip from the can and ties it around their forehead.]",

            "Jake: You want the can or the cup? [Pours half the contents of the can into a mug.]",

            "Jake: [Sips] Hmm. I'd hate it if my kids didn't ever see each other... [He frowns at a 'picture' of the puppies and one of Lady Rainicorn, made from his hand.] Or if Viola shoved Jake Jr. down a dream hole.",

            "[He pokes one of the shapes from the hologram. Air hisses, the room fills with smoke and part of the device launches through the roof of the tree fort and upwards until it disappears. BMO is still holding on to the rope, and the force of the launch sends them flying.]",

            "[The scene changes to show Finn riding Jake away from the tree fort in daylight and arriving in the evening at a forest. Jake shrinks down to normal size and they continue through the woods. Demonic shadows watch them through the trees.]",
            "Finn: There's a lot more demons here than I remember.",
            "Jake: Huh. Yeah. The only constant is change, bro.",

            "[It roars, and a smaller head emerges from its mouth like a tongue. Finn and Jake scream. They run full-tilt up the hill to the house. The tongue-head chases them and tries to bite Jake. It hisses, and Jake jumps out of the way.]",

            "[Finn stops running to look back.]",
            "Finn: Jake!",

            "Finn: Woah!",
            "[Finn turns towards the house again. Jermaine is wearing the bear costume from Jake's dream and holding a crossbow on the front step of the house.]",
            "Jermaine: Oh, you guys really came. Quick, get behind the salt barrier!",
            "[Finn and Jake race past a line of salt drawn in a circle around the house. The horde of demons crashes into an invisible barrier marked by the line.]",
            "Jermaine: They can't cross the circle. It's made from Dad's old shaman-blessed, sage-infused salt.",
            "Shadow Demon 2: Return my cup! Return my cup--[Finn, off-screen, pokes the demon's face with his sword.] Stop poking me!",

            "Jermaine: Knock it off, guys. Just get in the house.",
            "[Cut to the inside of the house. Jermaine enters, sets the crossbow down and takes off the bear costume.]",
            "Jermaine: You guys can chill here 'till morning, when the demons thin out a little.",
            "Finn: [Handsprings past Jermaine into the house.] Whoo!",
            "Jermaine: Oh, Finn--Oh no! Instant regret!",
            "[He chases after Finn. Jake watches sympathetically from the doorway. Finn continues to do handsprings through the hall. He bounces off a wall, knocking down two framed pictures, and runs down the hall to the kitchen.]",
            "Finn: Whoo! My house, my house!",
            "Jermaine: [Still chasing Finn,] Instant regret!",
            "[[Cut to Jermaine in the doorway of the kitchen. He gasps. We see Finn swinging from the hanging light over the dining table.]",

            "Jermaine: I don't care about that memory!",
            "Finn: What?",
            "[The light cord snaps and flings Finn into the wall.]",

            "[The sword tips over and Jake falls, cutting the table in half.]",
            "Jermaine: Okay, no more sleepover!",
            "Finn: Oh no! Don't--don't kick us out!",
            "Jermaine: Go do your Gaucho Marx slapstick with them goofballs in the woods. I got a responsibility to all this booty in here--Staves, medallions, cups, goblets, [the cups and goblets rattle,] dormant jinn, grimoires, hard-drives... All this random valuable booty, okay?",
            "[Watch beeping]",

            "[The scene cuts to the basement, where Booboo Sousa sits facing a large blue demon. Several large cables lead from the bear to the bare stone walls. It forms the edge of the forcefield keeping the demon contained. Jermaine crosses the room to the bear.]",

            "Bryce: You're gonna miss that alarm one day, and I'm gonna eat you from the bottom up, [slams his face against the forcefield,] so you can watch me while I eat you. Then, in my triumph, I will retrieve the poster your dad stole from me.",

            "Bryce: How dare you use tacks on my poster! You're gonna get it, man!",
            "Jermaine: You know, Bryce, I would've let you and your poster go years ago if you'd stop it with all that \"from the bottom up\" talk.",
            "Bryce: You would?",
            "Jermaine: Yeah, man! I don't want to flip that tape all day! That's you and Joshua beef 'cause you wouldn't stop breaking in for that poster.",
            "Bryce: Well, come on man, let's be bros!",
            "Jermaine: No way, you psycho. I ain't never gonna trust you after all that stuff you said. [He turns and walks away.]",

            "Jermaine: I don't need a plan B. I'm responsible. You guys want fried rice or something? I can make fried rice.",
            "Jake: No, Jermaine, we'll make you fried rice.",
            "Jermaine: Okay, just don't break any more junk. That's our parents' valuable artifacts, you knuckleheads.",
            "Bryce: I'm gonna white-knuckle you, Jermaine! You'll see!",

            "Jermaine: Dang, dude, this fried rice destroys. How'd you get all this flavor?",
            "Jake: Sesame oil and salt. Salt is one of the five taste sensations.",
            "Finn: [Counting them off on his fingers,] Sweet, sour, bitter, umami and salty.",
            "Jermaine: I guess I'm just used to bitter. [A beat.] That's weird. I haven't had salt in like five years. Hold on...",
            "[Jermaine sets his fork down to make a square with his hands, thumbs to opposite index finger. He reverses the gesture several times.]",

            "Jermaine: [To Jake,] That sword's too unweildy, man.",
            "Jake: But it'll look decent when I triple combo this bozo with this thing, right?",
            "[Jake raises the sword over his head with great difficulty. He's bent backwards under its weight.]",

            "Kim Kil Whan: You have one hour! Bye, dad. [He teleports out.]",
            "Jake: I wonder what it could be.",
            "Finn: Maybe it's a gross rotting fish gob with long, slimy tentacles.",
            "Jake: Maybe it's a teenage silverware werewolf squatter.",
            "Finn: Hey, you know what it could be? It could be a ghost. I think I saw a ghost there when I was a baby. Maybe it's like a ghost hotspot.",
            "Jake: Ghosts, huh? Whoa, wait! What if it's...",
            "Finn and Jake: [Together] Ghost Mom and Dad!",

            "Finn: Hey Jake, why don't we own this place?",
            "Jake: I dunno. Kim Kil Whan is a good businessman. Plus I'd feel kinda weird dealing with this stuff.",
            "Finn: Yeah. Just looking at all this is like, \"Whoa, memories!\" Like this ticker tape machine. Remember when Mom and Dad brought us to work and we made a fort of ticker tape?",
            "Jake: It was right over there! And over here you gave me a wet willie one time.",
            "Finn: Ew. No I didn't.",
            "Jake: Right. I know you believe that's true, but memories distort over time. Classic false memory syndrome.",

            "Finn: Anything?",
            "Jake: Nope. This is a nice bathroom, though. Man, this whole office is nice. It's kinda bunk how Mom and Dad stopped using it.",
            "Finn: Yeah, it's weird that they had this whole other life, and they just dropped it for us babies.",
            "Jake: We were babies forever.",
            "Finn: Man, we suck.",
            "Jake: [Exiting the bathroom] Yeah, but they knew what they were getting into. Whoa! Who moved the sofa? Who put forth those chairs?! Who set the table?! What's going on?!",
            "Finn: This griz is poltergeist biz.",
            "Jake: But I don't want that.",
            "Finn: Embrace the paranormal, bro. [Examining the candles on the dining table] Are these candles real or poltergeist mind-tricks?",

            "Margaret: Hello.",
            "Joshua: We're making this tape to document the strange phenomena in our new office. Like this weird message spelled out in- [Joshua accidentally tramples the message.] Oh, applesauce.",
            "Margaret: You've really stepped in it now, darling.",
            "Joshua: Indubitably. But something is definitely trying to chat us up, and we're gonna catch it on film. I got this fancy ghost-hunting doohickey. It's supposed to record EVPs and such. [The ticking is heard, and Joshua gasps. A ghostly silhouette appears behind him.]",
            "Margaret: Gracious, there it is!",
            "Joshua: Margaret! Margaret! There's another one over here!",
            "[Another ghost charges out of the bathroom and throws a chair into the camera. Margaret screams and the video cuts out.]",
            "Finn: Dude! This place is full of ghosts! We should split up and see if we can get them to appear.",
            "Jake: I'll take the bathroom!",

            "Finn: Maybe Mom and Dad left some books about ghost hunting. Hmm. [He examines some of the books on the shelf, then hears the ticking again. A ghost appears from around the corner.]",
            "Finn: [Gasps] A ghost! [The ghost fades away.] It seems like the ticking precedes each ghost encounter. Okay, Finn, what ticks? Metronomes, bombs, pencils...",
            "[Cut to the bathroom, where Jake is cowering in fear, his teeth chattering.]",
            "Jake: The bathroom is a lot scarier than I was expecting.",
            "[The ticking is heard, and then a ghost barges into the bathroom in the same manner that Jake did earlier. Jake screams, then the scene cuts back to Finn.]",
            "Finn: ...hearts, egg timers, typewriters.",
            "[Jake runs through the room and throws the chairs out of his way, just like the ghost on the tape.]",
            "Finn: What else? [The ticking is heard, and three small ghosts appear next to Finn.] Whoa, lil' ghost babies! Wait, that's baby Jermaine! And baby Jake! And baby me!",
            "Baby Jake: Babababa!",
            "[Baby Jake hits Baby Finn playfully and giggles.]",

            "Finn: [Laughs] Oh, snap. I guess it was me. Hold on. These babies ain't ghoulish ghosts at all. They're like time... disto...to...morphs? Hmm.",
            "[The scene changes. Jake emerges from the kitchen, with a makeshift suit of armor made of frying pans.]",
            "Jake: Scared? No way! I'm primitive! I'm real! Ghosts, you can't touch this dog! You've got ethereal hands! I'm alive! I'm filled with hot blood! You'll never see through me! [He bursts into the bathroom again.] Gotcha, ghoul!",
            "[Instead of the same bathroom as before, the room is instead furnished with futuristic decor. A mole man is sat on a sci-fi toilet reading a newspaper.]",
            "Mole Man: Pardon?",
            "Jake: Aah! Oh, sorry for interrupting your poop. [Jake exits, takes a second to process what he just saw, and then re-enters with his eyes covered.] Hey, sorry again, man, but I have a qu- [Gasps]",
            "[The design of the room has changed again, this time to contain fancy nineteenth century decor. A human woman in a dress is powdering her face.]",
            "Woman: [Screams]",
            "Jake: [Screams and exits again.] I gotta get out of here! No, Jake. You gotta stay for your boy Kim Kil Whan. Ghost! Quit freeloading off my son! [Barging into the bathroom one more time.] That's a father's job. [The bathroom is back to normal, but Jake hears Joshua's voice from the window.]",
            "Joshua: [Strained] Margaret, stay away!",
            "Jake: Huh? [He looks out the window.]",
            "Joshua: Something's about to happen!",
            "Jake: Dad?",
            "[The scene cuts back to Finn and the babies.]",
            "Finn: So, I can see you, and you can see me. And we're occupying the same space now. So this time stuff must be getting more intense. [The shape-shifter appears at the window.] Whoa!",
            "Baby Jake: [Straining] [Farts loudly, his diaper sagging downward] [Sighs with relief]",
            "Finn: [Sniffs the air] [Holds Baby Jake away] Aw, dude! You couldn't wait until you were back in your own time?",
            "[The shape-shifter stares inside at Baby Jake and exhales on the glass.]",
            "Finn: Hey, creeper, stop creepin' on baby Jake! [The shape-shifter exits, and the babies disappear.] Baby Jake?",
            "Jake: [Enters] Finn! I'm freaking out, man! I just saw the most messed-up thing!",
            "[A flashback begins. Jake is at the window, looking out at his parents in the alleyway. It is a repeat of Jake's birth, as previously seen in \"Joshua and Margaret Investigations\".]",
            "Jake: Dad?",
            "Joshua: Margaret, stay away! Something's about to happen!",
            "Margaret: Something's about to happen with me, too!",

            "[The flashback ends.]",
            "Jake: That's so not how I was birthed! I'm no melon baby! I'm a majestic womb baby!",

            "[A ticking begins, and Jake from the future appears as a ghost to Rennie, who is a ghost himself from Jake's perspective. Jake gasps and shape-shifts into a screaming tentacle monster. Rennie screams and becomes petrified, as seen earlier.]",
            "Jake: Aah! [He exits.]",
            "[Rennie leaves through the front door again. His phone rings.]",

            "Jake: We're trapped in a ghost trap!",
            "Finn: Relax, bro. There's no ghosts. What we're experiencing are time slips. Point is, something is causing this.",
            "[There is a ticking and a shattering sound as an unknown time ghost breaks the window and enters the house. It climbs into the attic.]",
            "Finn: You ready?",
            "[Jake looks uneasy, and holds Finn's hand. They follow the time ghost into the attic. They see three ghosts there, and there is a constant ticking.]",
            "Finn: Time dingalings! Wait, that ticking. I know who this is! [He and Jake walk over to the ghosts, where they take the place of two of them; their future selves. The third ghost resolves, and is revealed to be Clock Bear.] Clock Bear!",
            "Jake: One of the dudes that escaped Dr. Gross' menagerie.",
            "Finn: He must be the one causing the time slips. There's us from before. [He points to the attic's entrance hatch, where their past selves are climbing up.]",

            "Finn: Are you sick?",
            "Jake: Yeah, I'm pretty disgusted with the whole situation!",
            "Finn: I meant Clock Bear.",
            "[Clock Bear groans again and falls onto his stomach. His winding key stops moving. The ticking stops. Finn hesitates, and then begins winding him up again. All of the time ghosts in the house begin to be sucked back into Clock Bear's mechanisms. There is a sound of rushing wind and the constant ticking of clockwork.]",
            "Finn: [Shouting over the noise] He's sucking up all the spilled time!",
            "Jake: That doesn't sound scientific!",
            "Finn: [Gasps] Jake, take care of Clock Bear. There's something I gotta do!",
            "Jake: Wait, I'm still confused! And having feelings!",
            "[Finn rushes downstairs to the ticker tape machine. He takes a length of tape and begins arranging it on the floor. The scene changes to show Joshua and Margaret in the same room, in the past. Margaret has lain the table and is putting forth the chairs. Joshua spots the tape arranging itself.]",
            "Joshua: Oh boy, our first case! Looks like we have a poltergeist! [The tape spells out \"I love u\".] And it's got a little crush on me. What a sassafrass! Gotta get this one tape! [As he reaches for the tape on the bookshelf, he causes it to rattle and fall to the ground.] Whoops!",
            "[The scene changes back to the present once more. Jake, alone, enters the alleyway where he saw himself being born moments ago.]",
            "Jake: If this was all time weirdness, I guess that memory was true. I did see my own birth. Far out. [Jake suddenly notices that the shape-shifter is standing right next to him.] Oh! Must be a leftover time ghost. [The shape-shifter touches Jake's shoulder and he turns blue.] Hmm.",
            "Shape-shifter: We have to leave!",
            "Jake: We're doin' what now?",
            "[The scene changes. Finn is stood at the front of the house with Clock Bear, talking on the phone.]",
            "Finn: It was just Clock Bear... No, I don't think he has any money. [Finn hears something happening in the alleyway and hangs up.] Jake? Jake! [He enters the alleyway.] Oh, no! Something's happened to Jake! He could be in grave dang- [He spots a note on the ground. It reads \"BRB -Jake\".] ...Okay, then."

Jake grabs the just laid paper, reads it and then stretches his arm out back to the kitchen.

[Finn climbs down the garbage mountain. He finds a fallen mannequin with blue shorts on and stands it up. He makes a head from a basketball, a pink sweater, yellow undies, a broken plastic cup, and a spoon, resembling Princess Bubblegum's head.] Wow, PB, sure is a nice day to be outside! [Looks at the mannequin] Hey, watch what you say about PB, bro. Talk garbage about PB one more time, bro. See what happens! [to the basketball] Hold on one sec, PB. I gotta deal with a real tough guy over here. [He puts down the basketball and summons his grass sword] You got one last chance to apologize before I dishonor you like you did my lady! Alright, bro, have it your way! Yah! [Finn uses his sword to slice the mannequin's shorts off] Where's your pants bro? Where's your honor now? Everyone's laughing at your undies! It's real uncomfortable! Wants some! [He kicks the mannequin against the car, shaking the mountain of garbage.

            "Rattleballs: No. When I was a young robot, I went horseback riding. No one taught me how to post. The horse took a crazy jump, and I came down on the saddle hard. One of my gumballs bounced up inside me. It's been lodged in a weird spot for years.",

            "Finn: What the\u2014?! [He looks upon a piece of wood left of the shed, in the shape of Finn]",
            "Rattleballs: The shadowless thrust. Your blade must be swift enough to slice the air between you and the target, removing all wind resistance.

            "Slime Princess: Blargetha, why would you make a fake husband? You're so hot.",
            "Blargetha: You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you, because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you, because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives in a glob of gelatin and called it my lover.",
            "Finn: Well, I'm sorry, Blargetha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison 'cause what you're doing is illegal.",

They set up an elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque prank in the room, do a fist-bump, and leave. Lemongrab's alarm goes off, setting off the last part of the prank.

Now, on to more pressing matters. Brigands have been attacking our western seaports, dozens of unregistered princesses roam the land, and trade deficits are at an all-time high. Historically, Breakfast Kingdom has traded one sack of sugar a month to Slime Kingdom in exchange for four eggs, but egg production has plummeted!",

            "Breakfast Princess: Oh, Lumpy Space Princess, I'm afraid you'll have to be patient with us and our petty disputes. Not all of us have achieved the self-sufficiency that I assume you have in your kingdom. [gasps] Oh wait, that's right. You don't have a kingdom! You live in a box in the woods.",
            "Lumpy Space Princess: It's not a box. It's a rotting log.",

Finn uses a pencil to move little Finn\u2019s legs to walk towards Flame Princess. Flame Princess is pleasantly surprised to see little Finn and giggles. Little Finn breaks part of the cookie crumb off and gives it to Flame Princess. They then start to eat each end of what\u2019s left. Lady comes out of her teepee to see little Finn and Flame Princess and starts crying hysterically and runs back to the book house]",
            "[Finn then drops Princess Bubblegum in between Flame Princess and little Finn. At first they awkwardly stand around, but Finn moves Princess Bubblegum\u2019s hand onto little Finn\u2019s shoulder. She begins massaging his shoulders and he likes it. Real Finn looks around nervously to make sure no one can see what he\u2019s doing. Then they kiss and Flame Princess is outraged. She begins yelling at Princess Bubblegum and Princess Bubblegum yells back. Little Finn tries to diffuse the situation, but Flame Princess leaps onto Princess Bubblegum. Princess Bubblegum\u2019s dress catches on fire so she runs away into Lady\u2019s teepee. Using Lady as a kind of hose, the water being her tears, Princess Bubblegum partially extinguishes Flame Princess. They begin fighting and real Finn is astonished and begins blushing.]",

            "Jermaine: No one is making me do this. I painted so many landscapes that the shapes of the land began to lose their meaning. And the shapes broke apart to me, so I painted them like that. And it's not like my new paintings erase my old paintings. They're both me. Okay. I think I'm starting to get it. I like the new look, by the way.",

            "Warren Ampersand: No, I was dying. I needed to siphon your precious stretchy essence to keep me young and virile. I use these belts as a conduit. The more you stretch, the stronger I grow! I've done it hundreds of times, to hundreds of sons. [He demonstrates by stretching his palm to show himself draining energy from a set of other figures.] But I never felt guilty before. Maybe it's because you're so much cooler than my other kids.",

            "Banana Man: Let me explain. [backs up as the background changes to a diagram] The cylinder head is the top to the cylinder block. [points to cylinder head] Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust.",
            "Finn: Okay. Cool. Informative. [whispers to Jake] What is he pointing at?",
            "Banana Man: Now this lid is important because it works to get fuel into your engine. [clears throat] You see, your engine has cylinders, and these cylinders are pistons. When the piston in the cylinder moves down, it creates a vacuum, pulling in fuel from the intake.",

            "Banana Man: Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine. [clears throat]",

            "Banana Man: Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they're working on in the car. [walks over to the bed of the truck and finds the part] Ah! Bingo! [brings it to Finn and Jake] Found it.",
            "Finn: Yeah! Drive time!",
            "Banana Man: Well... n-not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off. Uh, it could be cracked, the gasket head could be warped, the rod bearings could have damage from water\u2014you see, that's the cool thing about cars. [clears throat] One tiny little thing messes everything else up so nothing works! So it's up to us to figure it out!",

            "Lumpy Space Princess:  It just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite. It's just like, um, y'know... werewolf rules? [Imitating a werewolf] Ar, rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!",

Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps... if I do turn... if I become lumpy like them, I want you to\u2014",

            "Finn:  LSP, we gotta hurry! Jake's running out of time!",
            "Lumpy Space Princess:  Hey. This is hard for me, too. I mean, I used to eat chili cheese fries with Brad... so there's gonna be a lot of romantic tension on this ride!",

            "Lenny:  Is this another friend of yours?",
            "Lumpy Space Princess:  What do you care? Just give 'em the antidote already, and stop being such a poser.",
            "Monty:  Sorry, kid. [exiting with Lenny and Glasses:] We changed our minds.",
            "Finn:  Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?!",
            "Lumpy Space Princess:  What? I was helping you.",
            "Finn:  [sarcastically:] Thanks a lot! [sincerely:] They were right about to hand over the antidote!",
            "Lumpy Space Princess:  [bitterly:] You're welcome a lot.",
            "Finn:  You insulted them! And they got mad! And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!",
            "Lumpy Space Princess:  Wow. Now I know how you really feel. I was just trying to help, but whatever. [raising her voice:] No. No, not whatever! I know I mess things up sometimes, but I'm really trying! And you're supposed to be my friend! [tearing up] Not like the fake ones I have here! So do what you want! I'm going to Promcoming! Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?",
            "Jake:  No. Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me! [Completely transforms into a Lumpy Space person.] Oh, yah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy. [Literally does so then exits]",
            "Finn:  JAKE! IT'S ALMOST SUNSET!! [to himself:] Jake... I didn't save him... I... [Yells wildly and angrily and then punches the ground repeatedly.] I'LL KILL YOU, LUMPY SPAAAAAACE!!",
            "Monty:  Jam on, man!",
            "Finn:  Huh? I thought you guys left!",
            "Monty:  We were drawn back by your plaintive wail. We dig your directionless fury.",
            "Finn:  Um, thanks.",
            "Monty:  Respect. Here. [Tosses Finn the sphere.] Take it. Win your girl back!",
            "Finn:  Yeah, there's no girl. But there is still time to save Jake! Do you guys know where Promcoming is?",
            "Monty:  Promcoming takes place way down on that land-lump.",
            "Finn:  Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels?",
            "Monty:  Nah. We were all ditched here just like you.",
            "Finn:  Well... you think I can make it to that land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?",
            "Monty:  You kidding?! A smoothie like you will plummet right into the eternal void!",
            "Finn:  What if I was lumpy? Could I float over?",
            "Lenny:  No, no! It's too dangerous!",
            "Glasses:  I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of you making it!",
